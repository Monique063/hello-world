I have been in the It field for 10 years, as a computer technician and ended up as a Network Analyst. In 2014 I was in a car accident that disabled me from my career. Being at home, with my eagerness of doing something, I decided that I wanted to design and development websites.  This lead me to Meetup in Birmingham, to this group for women in coding.

This change was made per the instructions in learning how to commit changes.
